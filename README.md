# Web-Scraper
This is my first personal project. A web scraper extracts data from websites by reading javaScript. I took advantage of the BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries in Python to develop these applications.  

I have 3 files in this project as of right now. Each of them are website specific, and output data into excel files. 
The first two are job websites that are designed for scraping, and the last one is IMDB. I planned on developing one for Twitter, but I realized an API implimentation would work better for that.
